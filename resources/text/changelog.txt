0.1.2

TMDB search language fixes

Discover help menu fixed

Integrated subtitle support removed

Ezra was using the Fen user_agent string to connect to opensubtitles. They are not issuing a new string for Ezra as they are moving to the new API. The new API however only allows 5 subtitles per IP per day unless the person is registered (There's ways round it). So it would need the API code completely writing from scratch but then would only support limited downloads. If you are registered it is better to use either the official opensubtitles addon, or the a4ksubtitles addon.
